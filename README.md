# Simplified DevOps Workflow with CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Monitoring for HealthCare Project

## Tools Used
- Git
- Docker
- Terraform
- Maven
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Kubernetes

## Description
This project aims to establish a streamlined DevOps integration pipeline by leveraging various tools, including Git, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes. The primary goal is to automate the end-to-end process, starting from code updates on the master branch to facilitate seamless tasks such as code checkout, compilation, packaging, and containerization. In addition, the project involves the use of Terraform and Ansible to set up a straightforward test-cluster environment. Kubernetes is employed to automate deployments to test servers, with the capability to extend this deployment process to production clusters. To ensure comprehensive monitoring, Prometheus is configured for data collection, while Grafana provides insightful visualizations.

## Key Features
- **CI/CD Automation:** Automated updates triggered on the master branch facilitate smooth code integration, compilation, packaging, and containerization.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform and Ansible are utilized for effortless test-cluster configuration and setup.
- **Efficient Deployment:** Kubernetes automates the deployment process, starting from test servers and potentially scaling to production clusters.
- **Monitoring and Insights:** Prometheus is employed to monitor various metrics, and Grafana is used to visualize performance data, providing valuable insights into the system's health.
- **Enhanced Workflow:** The project aims to enhance development workflows, promote scalability, and foster collaboration across different development stages.

## Benefits
- Improved development processes with automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Scalable infrastructure through Kubernetes-driven deployments.
- Simplified cluster setup and management using Terraform and Ansible.
- Enhanced team collaboration across various development stages.
- Valuable insights into system performance through Prometheus and Grafana monitoring.

By implementing this project, we anticipate achieving more efficient and collaborative development practices, ensuring smoother workflows, improved scalability, and better management of the entire software lifecycle.
